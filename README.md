What went well:

4 people per group worked very well for us.
Communication and checking in with each other.
Handling stress and consistent progress.

What didn't go well:

Learning more about git.
Too ambitious and managing expectations.
Figuring how to process and structure the different jobs so we are able to complete tasks and allow other people to start their tasks.

What we will do next time:
Look through and arrange the boiler plate ahead of time.
